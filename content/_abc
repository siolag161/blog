Summary: Always Be Coding

[Shamelessly copy the title from [here](https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/abc-always-be-coding-d5f8051afce2)]

I agree completely that one should always be coding. 

Back in high school, I was part of a special program called `gifted maths` where we would take
a lot of `advanced` mathematics classes, sometimes from University Profs. We also trained and
participated in many Maths Olympiads / Competitions. Solving math problems turned out to be
really fun (at least much more than it sounded as an idea, I know), and I was actually kinda good at this too,
winning a few prizes. I don't think I am particularly `gifted` at maths as I likened
this to sports where you can get some success if you practice hard everyday. Of course, to be at
the elite level is another question. But it's true that I spent a lot of time thinking about maths.

<!-- The highest level is IMO or International Mathematics Olmypiad.  -->
There was also a program for Informatics too where they focused on algorithms and data structures. We had
some classes together, mostly related to Discrete Maths. I think in our country, at least at my days,
we mostly used Pascal for coding during competition. This is also my first programming language.

When I went to Engineering School I continued to solve math problems from time to time but less and less
and at one point I stopped completely. Looking back I think it's a terrible idea. Solving problems requires
a long time of deep concentration and is a great intellectual exercises to keep our mind sane.
And the process can be fun too, oh the satisfaction after figuring out a neat solution.

The reason I mentioned all this is because recently I'm trying to to resume this hobby by learning about
 competitive programming. It's a bit late to the game, but rather late than never. Of course since I have only
limited free time, most of which is spent on other activities, the progress is rather slow but quite awarding.
First, I think unlike other kind of Olympiads, competitive programming can be easily understood by most professionals.
However, to come up with solutions requires having experience and deep knowledge in algorithms and data structures.
Also, I believe most likely virtually all the problems originally come from real work. It's just weird to think there're someone
who just sit there and produce these kinds of challenges.

Even though I've yet to touch the more advanced problems (let's say I'm more in the training/tutorial/newbie mode),
so far I have learned quite a lot and improved many aspects of my skills like debugging or
techniques related to bit manipulation. Coupled with working as a teaching assistant in a
Algorithm and Data Structure class this semester, I think I'm now much more efficient
and comfortable with coding than before, although not always working with algos or data structs.

I don't think I'm gonna be anywhere near those professional who participate in top competitions but
really investing some time every night to challenging yourself with some problems
and read up techniques, structures from books like CLRS can make quite a difference. It also makes me sleep better.
Strange.

Of course, not every one agrees with this since they consider doing these problems are just a waste of time, which
should be spent on doing real work. Some others simply prefer other kind of practice like [codekata](http://codekata.com/).
I've actually done codekata for a while, which is great too. You should totally try that.
Anyway, I'm not going to argue how one should do with his spare time, but this works for me and
as a bonus brings back some of those good memories so for now I'm totally ok to ABC - always be coding with this.

P/S: I don't know for sure but I suspect David took the idea of `ABC - Always Be Coding` from the
movie [Glengarry Glen Ross](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt).
