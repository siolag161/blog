my biggest professional mistake to&amp;nbsp;date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time it was not very clear to me what he meant by &amp;#8220;professional mistake&amp;#8221;, so I asked him
whether it was like some illegal thing or the like. Yeah, it was kind of silly, I agree but you have to understand
I was during an interview and I was quite&amp;nbsp;tense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else, I&amp;#8217;ve made tons of mistakes. Some are more painful than others. I typically take failure
very very hard, but it helps in the long term avoiding some of these previous ones. So after thinking for a bit,
I went with the time during my last-term internship. I remember it affecting me quite a lot, but I don&amp;#8217;t think my answer
was not that good, which is a shame because I really really like the position as I invested a lot a lot of my time on&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is there are some lessons we learned the hard way that completely changed the way we work
and thus we took them a bit for granted. After getting out of the office, I was thinking deeply about this,
leading to a note, which subsequently becomes this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="know-your-priorities"&gt;Know your priorities&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#know-your-priorities" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the mistake that I told the interviewer was where I had serialize and send data to the front-end where they are displayed
using some js visualization libraries. Now it does not seem like too much, but I was not a front-end/js guy (far from it),
so what I did was write some python wrappers for the visualization libraries since
that what my old team taught me (even though it was java and not python but the idea still holds).
The &amp;#8220;solution&amp;#8221; was ugly, complex and nasty. But the most important part is that it&amp;#8217;s very buggy,
so it took me a lot of time debugging and ironing out the errors, missing out on all the
&lt;code&gt;priorities&lt;/code&gt;. Yes, &lt;code&gt;priority&lt;/code&gt; is the key word here. I was tasked to help display the data, to solve a particular problem,
not to write wrappers! So I ended up end up doing tons and tons of extra time yet  without much success.
It was quite painful: the inertia, reverting to one&amp;#8217;s old shell without thinking. From that time one, everytime
I spent much more time on the design part before diving right in like crazy. Some are much better than me at this,
they do it intuitively but not me, I&amp;#8217;ve learned my&amp;nbsp;lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="copy-paste-is-evil"&gt;Copy-paste is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#copy-paste-is-evil" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? Yesterday I was teaching a course and see somebody was copying/pasting code from stackoverflow
and had trouble getting the right answer. The code was correct  but there&amp;#8217;s a twist: it&amp;#8217;s not quite
the same interface / precondition so one has to adapt a bit. I&amp;#8217;m not at all against using stackoverflow/gg but
at least we have to understand the solution and the problem we&amp;#8217;re solving.
So I asked him why he&amp;#8217;s struggling and walked him through the problem and the solution and it turned out very nice.
What he did actually reminds me a lot of&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back when i started I used to put a focus on the whole problem solving and not much on implementation and
I did a lot of copy-pasty from the net, especially when dealing with languages/frameworks that I was not familiar with.
It helps accomplish the task much faster, at least at the beginning. Therefore, when the problem arises again,
I just went ahead and took the old piece of code or searching, adapt a bitand put it&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#8217;s this one co-worker who saw me doing this all over the place so he taught me about the
&lt;code&gt;DRY principle&lt;/code&gt;. I did not quite get him until I had to deal with compilation errors when I change my mind but forget to
modify the code at all&amp;nbsp;places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, one day it just hits me that I already visited the same stackoverflow page multiple times,
which means I had not learned anything about this particular problem. Now I always always try to retype the whole thing first.
You get to much better understand the idea behind the code, as well as the details of implementation, thus avoid all the
subsequent problems. And it does not take that long, so it turns out we  actually save&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="always-write-unit-tests"&gt;Always write unit tests&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#always-write-unit-tests" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still think the biggest mistake I committed is not writing unittest properly also during an internship. At my school,
I actually don&amp;#8217;t remember we put a focus on this aspect. So in order to move faster, I completely ignore the whole
testing thing and hoped to get away with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me at that time, it works if the majority if for some cases it give the right behavior. Well, now
most of seasoned/experienced engineers know it&amp;#8217;s 100\% stupid and I agree with them. Because I had to take feedback from
the final client so the specs change constantly and boys the headache it gave me debugging/dealing with broken things.
It&amp;#8217;s a classical case of inexperience and I learned this lesson so hard now I&amp;#8217;m not even comfortable without unit tests.
I just don&amp;#8217;t feel safe. I just have to write some tests to sleep better at night.
There&amp;#8217;s someone like the guy in the first chapter of &amp;#8220;Coders at work&amp;#8221; who just knows that
his code works but not me, not&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="final"&gt;Final&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#final" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since many have now become a part of your workflow, incorporated with your workstyle you don&amp;#8217;t think much
about it anymore,  but if I got asked that question again, this would be my&amp;nbsp;answer. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dev"></category><category term="engineering"></category><category term="mistake"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry><entry><title>Idiomatic C++?</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/09/idiomatic-c/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-19T19:10:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-09-19:posts/2015/09/idiomatic-c/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first learned programming in C++ and then Java.
2 years later when I first coded in Python, I still remember being completely amazed by its elegance.
When a Python program is well written, it&amp;#8217;s always also very easy to read,
much like natural language, very succinct. Contrary to Java being extremely verbose.
I believe most of the time a beautiful Python code is also more&amp;nbsp;efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language has evolved over the year yet its &lt;code&gt;Pythonic&lt;/code&gt; way of writing code is somehow
always there, unlike many other&amp;nbsp;languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read a tons of C++ code, and while I don&amp;#8217;t expect it to be
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming"&gt;literate programming&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!-- it's could not say it's an lovely experience, especially --&gt;
the experience so far is quite disappointing, especially for non-experienced programmers.
You have C++99  and then we have the cool &lt;code&gt;modern C++&lt;/code&gt; which comprises of
&lt;code&gt;C++11, C++14, C++18&lt;/code&gt;. They all have very different, contrast styles. Plus, with heavy use of
templates in C++, I sometime find myself lost following the ideas behind the code.
Even with well-written&amp;nbsp;codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, recently I&amp;#8217;ve found this &lt;a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines"&gt;git repo called C++ guidelines &lt;/a&gt;
trying to change the situation  by consolidate all the best practices into one place.
The editors speak for themselves: Herb Sutter \&amp;amp; Bjarne&amp;nbsp;Stroustrup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it a very needed move, taken into account that modern C++ style is more and more adopted nowadays
(I didn&amp;#8217;t know of it when I was in college). After spending some time reading this guides, I&amp;#8217;ve already learned
quite a&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;#8217;t know how long it would take someone like me to change completely the style to adhere the core guidelines,
even with the best of intentions. You see, with Python after writing a piece of code, you just simply sense 
if you did something wrong or not, intuitively. Like it looks a bit ugly, or too much verbose, something like
that, triggering the urge for&amp;nbsp;refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With C++, it&amp;#8217;s just harder. Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, unlike many of my friends, I adore C++ and its power.
Maybe it comes with time, I don&amp;#8217;t know. But I know I&amp;#8217;m going to&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P/S: Since I wrote this I&amp;#8217;ve read quite a lot more about modern C++ from the guidelines
and the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996"&gt;Effective C++ book by Scott Meyers&lt;/a&gt;,
so far I&amp;#8217;m even more impressed and started to appreciate the &lt;code&gt;Idiomatc C++&lt;/code&gt;. You know when it starts to grow on you.
Going to C++ meetups at my city obviously also&amp;nbsp;helps.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dev"></category><category term="cpp"></category><category term="c++"></category><category term="coding-style"></category></entry><entry><title>Some more thoughts from my trip back home</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/09/some-more-thoughts-from-my-trip-back-home/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-07T18:35:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-09-07:posts/2015/09/some-more-thoughts-from-my-trip-back-home/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, I was avoiding work during my visit back home.
I called it &amp;#8220;e-detox&amp;#8221;. However, I did try to make some observations on
how people use tech in their daily life. One thing to note is that
I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to travel a lot, my I did spend time in multiple cities,
all of which are big and more developed however (like Sai Gon and Da&amp;nbsp;Nang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="people-use-smartphones-everwhere"&gt;People use smartphones everwhere&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#people-use-smartphones-everwhere" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually start my first day in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VN&lt;/span&gt; by fixing all the mobile devices in my home for
my family. I counted a grand number of 6. Take my mom for example, before I left
for college, she was technically useless. Now she was asking me how to integrate
her credit card to use Uber on her phone (more on this later). My gf, my father,
my sister and my brother in law all have one or more phones, all but one are&amp;nbsp;smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From those who I interact with, all use smartphone everytime everywhere. Either for
calling me here in France via skype/viber or send texts to their relatives on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;.
Most of the devices are Android, with Window Phones behind but you can spot
quite a lot of iPhones too. People still have some hope in the Nokia brand,
thus explaining the success of Microsoft/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mobile-plans-are-cheap"&gt;Mobile plans are cheap&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#mobile-plans-are-cheap" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find call/data plans rather cheap. You can buy, say &lt;span class="caps"&gt;3GB&lt;/span&gt; of data very easily from
billions of kiots from the streets. Otherwise you can go to any cafe and enjoy their
high-speed connection. This is expected, I never saw any cafe without a proper internet
connection. This is where people to go hangout with their friend next to a cup of coffee,
surfing the nets and for some, getting some work&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card is equally easy. I think I paid 10e for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card, with some
data credit and yet I still had some left. With that price, I could live with
the connection&amp;nbsp;instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the people I know use prepaid plan and never on contract, very different from&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="fb-is-king"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; is king&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#fb-is-king" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;#8217;s on fb, despite all the efforts from the goverment.
There exist some competition from local services that are quite
decent like Yalo (that I don&amp;#8217;t use due to privacy concerns)
and Viber/Skype (for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTT&lt;/span&gt; calling/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;). I don&amp;#8217;t think a lot of people use
Twitter, yet forums are still very&amp;nbsp;popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="e-commerce-e-payment"&gt;E-commerce / e-payment&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#e-commerce-e-payment" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to always have some cash with you. More and more merchandises accept
cards but far from ubiquitous and the fees are quite excessive. I successfully
convinced my mom to go to the bank to get a debit card with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VISA&lt;/span&gt; so see can
use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; instead of taxis. Yeah, she hated taxis that much since getting
an account/card is not an easy task (I&amp;#8217;ll write about my own expereine in the future).
Then right after that, probably one day or twos, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; announced they give it up
and allowed cash for transactions.&amp;nbsp;Well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, she could use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VISA&lt;/span&gt; for tons other things. E-commerce is still
in its very first step of development but has a very bright future. Since cash
rules, people opt for paying by cash on delivery. I find it rather uncomfortable
but many really dont trust&amp;nbsp;e-payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="end"&gt;End&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#end" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a chance to talk to my friend who are very involved in the tech scene in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VN&lt;/span&gt;.
They&amp;#8217;re all very optimistic about the future. Smartphones with connection easy to get,
people being high tech savvy and their very own habits, tons of things waiting
for being disrupted; all of those shouting&amp;nbsp;potential. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="tech"></category><category term="dev"></category><category term="stuffs"></category></entry><entry><title>The case of Latex in today’s world</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/09/the-case-of-latex-in-todays-world/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-04T13:04:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-09-04:posts/2015/09/the-case-of-latex-in-todays-world/</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we even learn&amp;nbsp;Latex?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question was raised by a student of my during my class on
&lt;code&gt;research methodology&lt;/code&gt;. Exactly, we should ask ourself the same thing
everytime we think about picking a new thing to&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;code&gt;research methodology&lt;/code&gt; class, we discussed about doing research
in private/public institutions, how one gather and structure information.
We actually spent quite some time talking about the opensource
tools and how to produce scientific documents, hence Latex,
which leads to the question&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the student ever used Latex. Some of them know about it, but
they think it&amp;#8217;s mostly used by academics and broke senior who can&amp;#8217;t
afford &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Word for writing their thesis. I knew I would have
a hard time convincing them for using Latex on regular basic.
Because I personally do not,&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the whole &lt;code&gt;Word vs Latex&lt;/code&gt; has been around forever, much like
&lt;code&gt;iinux vs windows&lt;/code&gt;, some even claim that writing in words make us
&lt;a href="http://mappingignorance.org/2015/04/06/word-or-latex-typesetting-which-one-is-more-productive-finally-scientifically-assessed/"&gt;more productive&lt;/a&gt;.
Obviously I&amp;#8217;m well aware of its superior quality of typography.
I also know we should worry about structure the content while tweaking the
the appearance simultaneously. Don&amp;#8217;t worry, I already did my own&amp;nbsp;homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, one should just say: it depends on what you want to accomplish.
But truth be told, as much as I&amp;#8217;m impressed with how well it is at rendering
maths formula, i don&amp;#8217;t find it easy to find a good use case for it beside
writing scientific&amp;nbsp;documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Typically, when you want to publish an article you can go to the he publishers's site --&gt;

&lt;!-- where they already have a styling file available to make ensure the --&gt;

&lt;!-- consitence of the look-and-feel of the submitted works. That way, like mentioned above, --&gt;

&lt;!-- you can worry less about styling your work. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, every time I need to write a note, there&amp;#8217;s google doc, evernote,
onenote, handle and a trillions of applications out there. For this blog,
I use Markdow, a lightway markup language that has much more flexibility to offer.
So why bother with a language that has a rather steep learning&amp;nbsp;curve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday, I learnt about &lt;a href="https://www.madoko.net/"&gt;Madoko&lt;/a&gt; which
is supposed to allow you to write books, articles with extensive use of
scientific formulas. As mentioned above, there exist already multiple
engines/processors that are able to output your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; documents into
&lt;code&gt;pdf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face it, this web-form should be the norms already. Dont get me wrong,
&lt;code&gt;pdf&lt;/code&gt; is great,for printing but ever try reading on a mobile device?
Such a painful experience. With recent trends of
&lt;a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/"&gt;R markdown&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html"&gt;Python notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, where we can put
our code snippets with data to make reproducible&amp;nbsp;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some publishers don&amp;#8217;t require the original &lt;code&gt;.tex&lt;/code&gt; as submit, only the final
pdfs suffice, I expect that the trends continue to grow and take over
in the near&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to the question at the beginning, told my students: &amp;#8220;well, you should
learn Latex because il will be covered in the Final&amp;nbsp;exams.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know,&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dev"></category></entry><entry><title>Random thoughts after my trip back to home</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/08/random-thoughts-after-my-trip-back-to-home/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-08-30T21:44:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-08-30:posts/2015/08/random-thoughts-after-my-trip-back-to-home/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The longer one hesitates before the door the stranger one becomes&amp;#8221;.
Several weeks ago, after nearly one year, I decided enough is enough and went to buy the plane&amp;nbsp;ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always thought that home is not fixed to a place but rather where your loved ones are.
Well, in this case my long-time girl friend and all of my family are currently back in my home&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a tremendous time there, letting your guard down being around those you care most about.
Not to mention food: I could eat properly again. Mom, if you&amp;#8217;re reading this (I highly doubt),
I really miss your cooking. I also had a chance to catch up with my old friends, see what&amp;#8217;re they up to
(Ok, i lied, I can do that on facebook too), made some new amazing friends and heard some great stories
to tell people here in&amp;nbsp;France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my going flight, I sat next to this young German dude called Tim. Tim is a police office traveling with
another country fellow whose name I did not catch. Anyway, I learned a great deal about his line of work in Germany
after our conversations which lasted hours. As Tim &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; his friend traveled with a &amp;#8220;surprise me&amp;#8221; mindset they didn&amp;#8217;t plan
any thing, at all. So I tried to give him some suggestions and recommendations, you know like what bar to hit and how
to go around, things like that. I also convinced him to go check-out a striking bay called &amp;#8220;Ha Long&amp;#8221;, a very famous tourist
destination. The thing is I hadn&amp;#8217;t check the news before that as there were heavy flooding and waste pollution
from surrounding coal mines that caused around 20 deaths! I tried to warn him by email but I have yet to receive his reply, so i&amp;#8217;m a bit&amp;nbsp;worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, most of the time I tried not to work. It&amp;#8217;s a bit weird since I tend to use my laptop a lot.
If not in the office, I would be reading something or learning a new stuff or just messing around out of curiosity.
I would also from time to time help out my girl friend with her work related to programming, mostly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VBA&lt;/span&gt; stuffs.
So yeah, it&amp;#8217;s probably the longest period of time I don&amp;#8217;t code over the last few&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as usual, I did a ton of technical support meaning cleaning home &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, upgrading the machines, installing AdBlocks,
I even config a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; for my brother in law&amp;#8217;s company &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;. At least, it&amp;#8217;s not via TeamViewer,
I told to myself so it&amp;#8217;s (probably) all&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time flies like an arrow, the vacation&amp;#8217;s finally over before I even knew it. I really wished I could stay a bit longer
so that I could spend more time with my girl friend. Let my tell you one more time: long distance relationship sucks!
But I guess &amp;#8220;how lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard&amp;#8221;, so, thanks for making it a great trip everybody!
I miss you all (you too Tim, if you&amp;#8217;re still&amp;nbsp;alive)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="stuffs"></category></entry><entry><title>Markov Chain for Text Generation</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/07/markov-chain-for-text-generation/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-26T17:43:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-07-26:posts/2015/07/markov-chain-for-text-generation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I stumbled upon &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3ei3i7/theres_a_bot_that_comments_as_you_based_on_your/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who are not familiar with these kind of bots. Basically, they&amp;#8217;re some program
that systematically scan new posts in certain subreddits (sub-forums kind-of) and
then trigger some actions based on some pre-defined rules. For example, a bot
would periodically visit the &lt;code&gt;soccer&lt;/code&gt; subreddit and everytime it see a youtube video posted,
it would try to download this video and upload to another video services (since youtube is famous, understandably,
for being very aggressive in video&amp;nbsp;deletion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, if we type a username and then the bot&amp;#8217;s name, the bot would then scan
the user&amp;#8217;s comment history and generate some funny nonsense comment. It was an instant hit
due to some gems&amp;nbsp;like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comment is so terrible that it might just use him as the primary ball handler
off the top 5 mid-range shooter in the future.
Anthony Davis 43 pts / 10 reb / 3 blk. He won&amp;#8217;t be a hall of&amp;nbsp;famer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or, you know, because it&amp;#8217;s the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;offseason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can they do it? Actually it&amp;#8217;s the same way people build &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney"&gt;chatbot&lt;/a&gt; back in the day.
I think today it&amp;#8217;s getting much more complicated, but maybe they just got more data?
Either case, the engine&amp;#8217;s behind the scene is something called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"&gt;&amp;#8220;Markov chain&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="markov-model-for-english-text"&gt;Markov model for English text&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#markov-model-for-english-text" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to understand the way text/document are models. I&amp;#8217;m definitely not going into details
here but roughly speaking, a text can be thought as a sequence of words (actually &lt;code&gt;shingles&lt;/code&gt;, but more on that later),
based on some loosely defined rules. What do I mean by &lt;code&gt;loosely defined&lt;/code&gt;? Let&amp;#8217;s consider this&amp;nbsp;sentence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself wishing Berg focused more on Brower&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can think it as a sequence of [&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;found&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;myself&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wishing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Berg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;focused&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;more&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code&gt;on&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Brower's&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;investigations&lt;/code&gt;]. So if I were a child and that&amp;#8217;s the first time I heard an English
sentence, since no ones taught me grammar yet, I would think that well, based on my own observation,
a sentence probably starts always with an &lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;, and then follows by &lt;code&gt;found&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;myself&lt;/code&gt; and so on.
Which means here we ignore virtually everything about the grammar (tenses, positions,&amp;nbsp;etc&amp;#8230;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then maybe after that, I see and hear more and more then probably I would get that sometime there&amp;#8217;re more verbs
then &lt;code&gt;found&lt;/code&gt;. Probably there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;code&gt;he&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;she&lt;/code&gt; which acts as the subject also. More precisely,
let&amp;#8217;s say I heard another&amp;nbsp;sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found him to be quite&amp;nbsp;ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now, &lt;code&gt;found&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;myself&lt;/code&gt; but there&amp;#8217;s a 50% chance it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;strong&gt;him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we just described is called 2-order Markov chain model for text generation. Indeed, the &lt;code&gt;1-order&lt;/code&gt; part
refers to the fact we only use a sequences of pair of consecutive words to form a sentence.
We look at (&amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217;), then (&amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;him&amp;#8217;) or (&amp;#8216;found&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;myself&amp;#8217;) and so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, it&amp;#8217;s my turn to talk back. I would construct a sentence by &lt;code&gt;chaining&lt;/code&gt; the &amp;#8216;pairs&amp;#8217; together until I hit
something that marks the end (like &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; or &amp;#8216;!&amp;#8217;). More technically correct, after building the model,
we would obtain a random graph, and in order to generate the text, we perform simply a random walk in this&amp;nbsp;graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such pair is often called &amp;#8216;bigram&amp;#8217;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram"&gt;more on that here for the general case&lt;/a&gt;.
People find that an order between &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; would get the job done in most&amp;nbsp;cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-to-learn-the-model"&gt;How to learn the model?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-learn-the-model" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may say that it looks quite simplist but it works pretty well in practice. It&amp;#8217;s also quite easy
to write the code to train the model. We have to split the document into consecutive &lt;code&gt;n-gram&lt;/code&gt; (or shingles)
and then update the Markov chain&amp;#8217;s parameters, which consist only of the shingle&amp;#8217;s occurrences. Actually,
we learn the matrix of transition but it&amp;#8217;s not that&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplicity is partially due to the way English word separation works. Indeed, in English (or French and many other languages),
what separates 2 sepaxrate words is either a space or some punctuation (&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;, &amp;#8216;.&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;!&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8230;). In some other language like
Vietnamese, it&amp;#8217;d get much more complicated so obtain n-gram since there are composite words, like &amp;#8220;to quoc&amp;#8221; is just a word.
Actually in English there also &amp;#8220;composite words&amp;#8221; like this, the idea stills hold, we have to take into account the context&amp;nbsp;somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find much more information on the model on the internet, espcially on the theorical side. It&amp;#8217;s probably the most
basic model yet gives an important more general idea of how statistical learning approach works in natural langague&amp;nbsp;processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="nba-comment-bots-and-other-applications"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt; comment bot&amp;#8217;s and other applications&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#nba-comment-bots-and-other-applications" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications of such bot are vast. They used to power botchat. The way botchat works are that they already have a trained model,
it would generate the reply back to you using your sentence as &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;. For&amp;nbsp;example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may&amp;nbsp;say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s talk about&amp;nbsp;Bush&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then it would use [&lt;code&gt;talk&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;let's&lt;/code&gt;, &amp;#8216;Bush&amp;#8217;] as seeds for the next&amp;nbsp;reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bush is no longer in the office, Obama is. (using Bush)
Let&amp;#8217;s talk about Kim Kardashian instead (using&amp;nbsp;let&amp;#8217;s)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then use your text to update the model. I&amp;#8217;ve heard some model that&amp;#8217;s trained for decades, wondering around
in many chat channels, talking with generations of innocent&amp;nbsp;souls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBA&lt;/span&gt; bot (or twitterbot), the same ideas apply. But if you cross multiple contexts and text, for example
comment history with something serious such as the Bible, probably it&amp;#8217;d generate some rather amusing result (or offensive, it&amp;nbsp;depends!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also used to generate random fake comments (for example: &lt;code&gt;I heard that this product is pretty great&lt;/code&gt;)
but I think we should heavily tweak the model in order to bypass the&amp;nbsp;filter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="example"&gt;Example:&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/siolag161/markov_generator"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a yet another Markov model I coded in Python &lt;/a&gt; which use the book of Tao as input,&amp;nbsp;generating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: Is it not because it could not hurt men.

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: The softest thing in the Tao, the more implements to add to his own person last, and &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; not know it.

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: The excellence of a reward &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the things which I call it The Great.

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: There are few in the world delight to exalt him and &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; not know it.

&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;5&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: Therefore when one knows that the ancients prized this Tao, the more.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;it trains the model only in memory. If you want to train the model for years like those chatbots, you should have a database.
Probably just a lightweight one&amp;nbsp;suffices.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="nlp"></category><category term="dev"></category><category term="model"></category><category term="markov"></category></entry><entry><title>The Game of Git</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/07/the-game-of-git/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-20T23:12:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-07-20:posts/2015/07/the-game-of-git/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted on github pages, which means I gotta know a thing or two about git.

Using it virtually
everyday for the last 4 years, it saddens me. I&amp;#8217;m really fond of this model for various
reasons. It&amp;#8217;s extremely light and confortable, you can wear it for hours without feeling
anything. It does a decent job isolating
the sound, not as extreme as blocking anything so you can still sense the world
around you. While i&amp;#8217;m not anywhere near being an expert, I find the headphone
quite versatile, meaning I can listen to a very wide range and find the sound quality
delivered impressive most of the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being someone who always listen to &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; while working, I don&amp;#8217;t waste a lot of
time before searching for a new one. Some of my principal criteria&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confort: It should be over-the ear so it doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt
your head/ear (though I&amp;#8217;ve heard some on-ear models are extremely light they can
do the work&amp;nbsp;too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation: It should be able to to a decent job at this, as mentioned above. I don&amp;#8217;t
want to disburb others, for example in the bus or at&amp;nbsp;workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wear glasses, so sometimes on-ear is more confortable. Over-the-ears tend to leak
sound if you wear thick glasses, so gotta take that into account&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mic: It should have an in-line mic, or at least should not intefere with the phone&amp;#8217;s mic.
This is where the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt;-449 sucks. I don&amp;#8217;t know where the issue is but whenever I try
to answer call with my (now-deceased) headphone, the other one could not hear a thing.
Maybe it blocks the Nexus 5 mic, I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build-quality: i&amp;#8217;m looking for something that lasts for&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those being said, for the time being, I think I&amp;#8217;ll go with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AKG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;K545. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically I don&amp;#8217;t listen to anything with lyrics while working. Sometimes I go with
natural noises like rain (&lt;a href="http://www.rainymood.com/"&gt;rainymood&lt;/a&gt; for example);
othewise I&amp;#8217;d go with &lt;a href="http://www.di.fm/chillout/"&gt;chillout music&lt;/a&gt;;
Classical work great too, I usually go with Bach; Once in a while I play
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziw4yd5R0QI"&gt;Explosions in the sky&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbnhjsDI_ho"&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;. The latter band is recommended to me

and we would like to know whether it performs well. If we&amp;#8217;re really lucky and
have at disposal the ground truth (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;), we can check if the result we obtained (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;) with
the clustering algorithm are &lt;code&gt;similar&lt;/code&gt; to the said ground truth. What this means
is that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; should agree most of the time (relatively speaking) whether to
group two objects in a same group or in two seperate ones. In other words, they should
have a high degree of&amp;nbsp;agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;re several approaches to quantify the degree of agreement. Here since we know
the ground truth, we could use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis#External_evaluation"&gt;external measures&lt;/a&gt;.
Among these, there&amp;#8217;s this particular method based on &lt;code&gt;confusion matrix&lt;/code&gt; which is very widely used in classification,
to show how much &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is different from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="confustion-matrix"&gt;Confustion matrix&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#confustion-matrix" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to construct a such confusion matrix from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? One common way, from classification, is to
first represent a clustering as an array, mapping each object to the cluster it belongs to, like&amp;nbsp;so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;here we have 2 clusterings of 3 clusters on 6 objects. So we have 2 arrays of the same length and
the same cardinality &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confusion matrix has then a dimension of &lt;code&gt;TxT&lt;/code&gt; where each &lt;code&gt;(i,j)&lt;/code&gt; is
the number that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; classifies as &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; classifies as &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="problem-of-label-meaning"&gt;Problem of label meaning&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#problem-of-label-meaning" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal with this approach is that it doesn&amp;#8217;t work as properly in cluster analysis as in classification because
in classification each class has an underlying meaning, such as &amp;#8216;dog&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;cat&amp;#8217;, for example; wheareas in clustering
if we any permutation of the classes would&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if we compute the accuracy for these two&amp;nbsp;clusterings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;it would yield a value of &lt;code&gt;0.0&lt;/code&gt;!! but in reality it perfectly agrees on how to group objects in categories. So
we got it totally&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="label-matching"&gt;Label matching&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#label-matching" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naive way is to consider all the label permutations possible for
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and compares it with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and pick the one that minimizes the error.
Look at the example above. In the &lt;code&gt;(2)&lt;/code&gt; clustering, if we change the label &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;
to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; while fixing the rest labeling, we can see that we now have a
better result, in term of similarity to &lt;code&gt;(1)&lt;/code&gt;. It would not suffice however, under
&lt;!&amp;#8212; our conditions (the 2 label sets must match) we have to also assign &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; &amp;#8212;&gt;.
if we continue and assign &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; we can get even a better&amp;nbsp;labeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- But by how much did we improve? --&gt;

&lt;!-- Let's say we have 2 clustering `C1` and `C2`, --&gt;

&lt;!-- Indeed, one way to measure the distance between 2 clusterings is to count the  --&gt;

&lt;!-- We first define a cost function `f(c1, c2)` --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality we can do better than the brute force approach. Our problem is actually
equivalent to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem#Algorithms_and_generalizations"&gt;assigment problem&lt;/a&gt;
in which we assign labels to labels. We need to compute the cost matrix, however.
This is the complement of the gain matrix whose element &lt;code&gt;(i,j)&lt;/code&gt; is the number of
items that is classified as &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;in the first labeling and as &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; in the second&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a gist for matching label of a clustering obtained by &lt;code&gt;K-means&lt;/code&gt; to the
ground truth, on the famous &lt;code&gt;Iris&lt;/code&gt; dataset using the Hungarian algorithm,
also called&amp;nbsp;Munkres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need the &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scipy&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bmc/munkres"&gt;Munkres&amp;nbsp;package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was doing some data analysis where there&amp;#8217;s a intermediary step I had to store the result in a matrix of fixed size that
we know a priori. When it finished the calculation, I looked up to see it had given an very unexpected result. After
spending sometime trying to track the issue down, it turned out that there&amp;#8217;s a line where I initialized the matrix
like&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NROWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NCOLS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NCOLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NROWS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;what&amp;#8217;s wrong with this line is that it translates equivalently&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NROWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NCOLS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NCOLS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NROWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;so we got a matrix in which all the rows refer to the same list. To illustrate the&amp;nbsp;problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this behavior it&amp;#8217;s pretty well-known among python&amp;nbsp;dev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-to-fix-this"&gt;How to fix this?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-fix-this" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;re several ways actually. For example we can use list comprehension like&amp;nbsp;so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NROWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NCOLS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NCOLS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NROWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I ended up using the &lt;code&gt;numpy.zeros()&lt;/code&gt; function which I should have had done in the first place since the matrix would
eventually be converted into &lt;code&gt;numpy.array&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every language has its moments of &lt;code&gt;gotcha&lt;/code&gt;, as we grow more experienced, we will
get less error-prone. In &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; in particular, I also find the following

Normally I would love to
talk a bit about politics or history, but I have this priviledge coming from a communist country
where these kinds of stuffs would get you into troubles. So I guess writing a bit on how I get this blog
up and running might not be a bit &lt;em&gt;less complicated&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-to-get-started"&gt;How to get started&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-get-started" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/03/my-first-post-ever/"&gt;As mentioned earlier&lt;/a&gt;, this very blog was setup using the Pelican
static blog engine. As Pelican is quite popular, especially among Python fans (albeit not as popular
as its eternal enemy jekyll), there&amp;#8217;s no lack of &lt;a href="http://nafiulis.me/making-a-static-blog-with-pelican.html"&gt;great&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://terriyu.info/blog/posts/2013/07/pelican-setup/"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; out there helping you to get&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google it, you say? Well, obviously it might feel a bit overwhelming at first for those who do not have prior background in web dev.
But believe me once you&amp;#8217;re get your basic config up, you&amp;#8217;ll then get comfortable very quickly and everything
takes off from&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the most important thing with blogging with Pelican (or any static engine for that matters)
consists in finding a workflow that works for you. If you don&amp;#8217;t have one yet, well it&amp;#8217;s a great time
to pick one and&amp;nbsp;learn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the workflow choice, it should enable you to at least do these following&amp;nbsp;tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview the content of your posts and/or your site&amp;nbsp;(*)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the changes to the server&amp;nbsp;(**)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customizing the feel and look of your blog&amp;nbsp;(***)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally find the &lt;a href="http://nafiulis.me/making-a-static-blog-with-pelican.html"&gt;post by nafiulis&lt;/a&gt;
very comprehensive. Go read it and follows his instructions if you have no clues, highly&amp;nbsp;recommended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="my-own-setup"&gt;My own setup&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#my-own-setup" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-blogging-with-pelican-works-again"&gt;How blogging with Pelican works again?&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#how-blogging-with-pelican-works-again" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with Pelican, you write not in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; directly but in some markup language like Markdown or
reStructuredText. Pelican will take care of compiling the content that you write into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, coupled with
the style defined in your chosen theme to render the fancy blog posts. It comes with a default one, so need
to get your hand&amp;nbsp;dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="previewing-content"&gt;Previewing content&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#previewing-content" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first install Peliacan, it typically gives you a choice between a makefile and a Fabric script
for automating all the repetitive tasks. Either one allows you to take a peek before the post goes out into the wild.
More technically, it launches a local web server allowing you to see your site with the newly added posts.
Sounds great, battery included!  Bad new is every time you make some changes to your liking, let it be customizing your
theme or update the post, the server will not be aware of this yet and you have to refresh the browser manually. So much&amp;nbsp;hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- So there are several ways to solve this. For example one can use a text editor capable of automatically --&gt;

&lt;!-- render the post lik --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e
Obviously there are text editor our there that can help you do this automatically like &lt;a href=""&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; which gives you the a of the result &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;.
The incovenience is that it may not be able to take into account the look and feel from your blog&amp;#8217;s current&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many other, my approach is to use an automate tool like &lt;a href=""&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; since I was already using one.
The learning curve is rather steep, but after you set them up, you&amp;#8217;ll never have to look back. The concecus now is apparently 
&lt;a href=""&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt;. So if you&amp;#8217;ve never heard of either of them, it may be a great time to&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pushing-your-posts-to-the-server"&gt;Pushing your posts to the server&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#pushing-your-posts-to-the-server" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully disclose, I host this blog that no one reads without paying a dime at &lt;a href=""&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.
If you have never heard of github (or git), again seriously man go learn
at least the basics of them Once you get the principle ideas already, now we are presented with
different strategies to deploy our&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can render locally to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and push the changes to the distant server (by our friend at github
in my case). Or we can use the technique described &lt;a href="http://blog.mathieu-leplatre.info/publish-your-pelican-blog-on-github-pages-via-travis-ci.html"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;.
You see, regardless of strategies, we still need to use git (or mercurial but no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;, thanks) to
version-control our content. The later approach allows to leverage TravisCI and git-hooks to detect
every time we push the markup code to our github repo, then compile and push the rendered content
to the github page branch. Very nice and clean&amp;nbsp;method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="customizing-the-looks-and-feels"&gt;Customizing the looks and feels&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#customizing-the-looks-and-feels" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This parts requires some basic knowledge of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, you just can expect to get around it
and be alive. Again, if you opt for the Grunt (Gulp) solution, you should be fine here
as Grunt/Gulp will capture any modifications you make to reflect on the theme and allow you
to preview before going live. I normally don&amp;#8217;t do &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; directly but use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SASS&lt;/span&gt; instead, so an automation
tool is a must for me as no sane men compile them&amp;nbsp;manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You gotta agree with me here, being able to update your site requires more time than setting it up.
This is the most important part in your workflow yet no tools could help you&amp;nbsp;with!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>C++ environnement setup</title><link href="http://blog.pdt.space/posts/2015/03/c-environnement-setup/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-03-18T14:03:00+07:00</updated><author><name>pdt</name></author><id>tag:blog.pdt.space,2015-03-18:posts/2015/03/c-environnement-setup/</id><summary type="html">

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since last time I blogged, with Wordpress actually. It needs to be said, however, that I actually like Wordpress as a whole. It&amp;#8217;s a very versatile engine which serves many purposes and does it pretty well. I also have set up some sites of all kinds using this platform for my friends and would probably choose this it if asked&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is I know absolutely nothing about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, so I have to rely 100% on plugins to survive. So with time it becomes more and more bloated and sometimes they don&amp;#8217;t seem to play nice with each others. After a while I just grew too tired and throw my tower because I spent more time dealing with these issues I don&amp;#8217;t understand instead of writing. Last but not least I&amp;#8217;ve often had trouble with their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WISIWIG&lt;/span&gt; editor while online, especially when it comes to writing&amp;nbsp;code/maths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="comes-pelican"&gt;Comes Pelican&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#comes-pelican" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered the world of blog powered by static site generation several years ago when I wrote code an app in Python and learned to use Sphinx for documentation (docutils. I really like the idea of static site generator and I find it to be the perfect fit for writing documents like blog. The only problem I had with Sphinx is its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt; (reStructuredText)&amp;nbsp;syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I rediscover Pelican - the Python generator which allows you to write in either &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt; or Markdown( similar to the one used by Github for documentation - actually they are powered by Jenkyll the Ruby counterpart of&amp;nbsp;Pelican).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="advantages-of-pelican"&gt;Advantages of Pelican&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#advantages-of-pelican" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty, you can google it to see all the praises for yourself. Personally, as I&amp;#8217;ve already had django/jinja knowledge and python experience, I could do pretty much everything I want (but you have to note that I don&amp;#8217;t need that much! a theme, commenting system provided by Disqus and it&amp;#8217;s good to&amp;nbsp;go)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes me about an hour or two for setting up the whole thing (not including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; propagation) for the site to go up. It is hosted freely by Github pages and published automatically every time I push to the master branch ( so pushes to other branches are considered as&amp;nbsp;drafts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I may talk in details about how I setup my workflow ( I use the same for pretty much every web project) which may come in handy for&amp;nbsp;some.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dev"></category><category term="post"></category></entry></feed>
