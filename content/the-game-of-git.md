Summary: the git-name

This site is hosted on github pages, which means I gotta know a thing or two about git.
I actually use git everyday for my work, typing hundreds of commands but most of them
are from a select few: `checkout`, `diff`, `status`, `add`, `commit`, `checkout`, `push`, `pull`.
Sometimes you take it for granted and then you'd be getting right into troubles. I don't think
`git` is difficult, making the most out of it, on the other hand is. Also,
[making meaningful comments](https://xkcd.com/1296/)

Today I discovered [this repo](https://github.com/git-game/git-game) which is meant to be a game
for you to refresh your github knowledge in a fun way. I gave it a try and find indeed rather amusing.
Quite short though, takes you 5-10mins max.
