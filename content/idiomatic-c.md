Summary: Does it even exist?

I first learned programming in C++ and then Java.
2 years later when I first coded in Python, I still remember being completely amazed by its elegance.
When a Python program is well written, it's always also very easy to read,
much like natural language, very succinct. Contrary to Java being extremely verbose.
I believe most of the time a beautiful Python code is also more efficient.

The language has evolved over the year yet its `Pythonic` way of writing code is somehow
always there, unlike many other languages.

I have read a tons of C++ code, and while I don't expect it to be
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
<!-- it's could not say it's an lovely experience, especially -->
the experience so far is quite disappointing, especially for non-experienced programmers.
You have C++99  and then we have the cool `modern C++` which comprises of
`C++11, C++14, C++18`. They all have very different, contrast styles. Plus, with heavy use of
templates in C++, I sometime find myself lost following the ideas behind the code.
Even with well-written codebase.

Fortunately, recently I've found this [git repo called C++ guidelines ](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines)
trying to change the situation  by consolidate all the best practices into one place.
The editors speak for themselves: Herb Sutter \& Bjarne Stroustrup.

I find it a very needed move, taken into account that modern C++ style is more and more adopted nowadays
(I didn't know of it when I was in college). After spending some time reading this guides, I've already learned
quite a lot.

However, I don't know how long it would take someone like me to change completely the style to adhere the core guidelines,
even with the best of intentions. You see, with Python after writing a piece of code, you just simply sense 
if you did something wrong or not, intuitively. Like it looks a bit ugly, or too much verbose, something like
that, triggering the urge for refactoring.

With C++, it's just harder. Don't get me wrong, unlike many of my friends, I adore C++ and its power.
Maybe it comes with time, I don't know. But I know I'm going to try.


P/S: Since I wrote this I've read quite a lot more about modern C++ from the guidelines
and the [Effective C++ book by Scott Meyers](http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996),
so far I'm even more impressed and started to appreciate the `Idiomatc C++`. You know when it starts to grow on you.
Going to C++ meetups at my city obviously also helps.
