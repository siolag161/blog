Summary: Noisy programming

Today I f* up by breaking my beloved headphone Sennheiser HD 449. Using it virtually
everyday for the last 4 years, it saddens me. I'm really fond of this model for various
reasons. It's extremely light and confortable, you can wear it for hours without feeling
anything. It does a decent job isolating
the sound, not as extreme as blocking anything so you can still sense the world
around you. While i'm not anywhere near being an expert, I find the headphone
quite versatile, meaning I can listen to a very wide range and find the sound quality
delivered impressive most of the time.


Being someone who always listen to `something` while working, I don't waste a lot of
time before searching for a new one. Some of my principal criteria are:

* Confort: It should be over-the ear so it doesn't hurt
your head/ear (though I've heard some on-ear models are extremely light they can
do the work too).

* Isolation: It should be able to to a decent job at this, as mentioned above. I don't
want to disburb others, for example in the bus or at workplace.

* I wear glasses, so sometimes on-ear is more confortable. Over-the-ears tend to leak
sound if you wear thick glasses, so gotta take that into account too.

* Mic: It should have an in-line mic, or at least should not intefere with the phone's mic.
This is where the HD-449 sucks. I don't know where the issue is but whenever I try
to answer call with my (now-deceased) headphone, the other one could not hear a thing.
Maybe it blocks the Nexus 5 mic, I don't know.

* Build-quality: i'm looking for something that lasts for years.

Those being said, for the time being, I think I'll go with the AKG K545. 

Typically I don't listen to anything with lyrics while working. Sometimes I go with
natural noises like rain ([rainymood](http://www.rainymood.com/) for example);
othewise I'd go with [chillout music](http://www.di.fm/chillout/);
Classical work great too, I usually go with Bach; Once in a while I play
[Explosions in the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziw4yd5R0QI) or
[Mono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbnhjsDI_ho). The latter band is recommended to me
by my ex.
