Summary: curious case of Latex

> Why should we even learn Latex?

That question was raised by a student of my during my class on
`research methodology`. Exactly, we should ask ourself the same thing
everytime we think about picking a new thing to learn.

In this `research methodology` class, we discussed about doing research
in private/public institutions, how one gather and structure information.
We actually spent quite some time talking about the opensource
tools and how to produce scientific documents, hence Latex,
which leads to the question above.

None of the student ever used Latex. Some of them know about it, but
they think it's mostly used by academics and broke senior who can't
afford MS Word for writing their thesis. I knew I would have
a hard time convincing them for using Latex on regular basic.
Because I personally do not, either.

Well, the whole `Word vs Latex` has been around forever, much like
`iinux vs windows`, some even claim that writing in words make us
[more productive](http://mappingignorance.org/2015/04/06/word-or-latex-typesetting-which-one-is-more-productive-finally-scientifically-assessed/).
Obviously I'm well aware of its superior quality of typography.
I also know we should worry about structure the content while tweaking the
the appearance simultaneously. Don't worry, I already did my own homework.

Usually, one should just say: it depends on what you want to accomplish.
But truth be told, as much as I'm impressed with how well it is at rendering
maths formula, i don't find it easy to find a good use case for it beside
writing scientific documents.

<!-- Typically, when you want to publish an article you can go to the he publishers's site -->
<!-- where they already have a styling file available to make ensure the -->
<!-- consitence of the look-and-feel of the submitted works. That way, like mentioned above, -->
<!-- you can worry less about styling your work. -->


Otherwise, every time I need to write a note, there's google doc, evernote,
onenote, handle and a trillions of applications out there. For this blog,
I use Markdow, a lightway markup language that has much more flexibility to offer.
So why bother with a language that has a rather steep learning curve?

Just yesterday, I learnt about [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net/) which
is supposed to allow you to write books, articles with extensive use of
scientific formulas. As mentioned above, there exist already multiple
engines/processors that are able to output your MD documents into
`pdf` and `html` forms.

Let's face it, this web-form should be the norms already. Dont get me wrong,
`pdf` is great,for printing but ever try reading on a mobile device?
Such a painful experience. With recent trends of
[R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
and [Python notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), where we can put
our code snippets with data to make reproducible reports. 

As some publishers don't require the original `.tex` as submit, only the final
pdfs suffice, I expect that the trends continue to grow and take over
in the near future.

So back to the question at the beginning, told my students: "well, you should
learn Latex because il will be covered in the Final exams."

I know, right.
