Summary: Post-trip random thoughts

"The longer one hesitates before the door the stranger one becomes".
Several weeks ago, after nearly one year, I decided enough is enough and went to buy the plane ticket.

I've always thought that home is not fixed to a place but rather where your loved ones are.
Well, in this case my long-time girl friend and all of my family are currently back in my home country.

I had a tremendous time there, letting your guard down being around those you care most about.
Not to mention food: I could eat properly again. Mom, if you're reading this (I highly doubt),
I really miss your cooking. I also had a chance to catch up with my old friends, see what're they up to
(Ok, i lied, I can do that on facebook too), made some new amazing friends and heard some great stories
to tell people here in France.

During my going flight, I sat next to this young German dude called Tim. Tim is a police office traveling with
another country fellow whose name I did not catch. Anyway, I learned a great deal about his line of work in Germany
after our conversations which lasted hours. As Tim & his friend traveled with a "surprise me" mindset they didn't plan
any thing, at all. So I tried to give him some suggestions and recommendations, you know like what bar to hit and how
to go around, things like that. I also convinced him to go check-out a striking bay called "Ha Long", a very famous tourist
destination. The thing is I hadn't check the news before that as there were heavy flooding and waste pollution
from surrounding coal mines that caused around 20 deaths! I tried to warn him by email but I have yet to receive his reply, so i'm a bit worried.

Otherwise, most of the time I tried not to work. It's a bit weird since I tend to use my laptop a lot.
If not in the office, I would be reading something or learning a new stuff or just messing around out of curiosity.
I would also from time to time help out my girl friend with her work related to programming, mostly VBA stuffs.
So yeah, it's probably the longest period of time I don't code over the last few years.

But as usual, I did a ton of technical support meaning cleaning home PC, upgrading the machines, installing AdBlocks,
I even config a new PC for my brother in law's company PC. At least, it's not via TeamViewer,
I told to myself so it's (probably) all good.

Time flies like an arrow, the vacation's finally over before I even knew it. I really wished I could stay a bit longer
so that I could spend more time with my girl friend. Let my tell you one more time: long distance relationship sucks!
But I guess "how lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard", so, thanks for making it a great trip everybody!
I miss you all (you too Tim, if you're still alive)
