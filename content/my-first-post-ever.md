#Goodbye Wordpress

It's been a while since last time I blogged, with Wordpress actually. It needs to be said, however, that I actually like Wordpress as a whole. It's a very versatile engine which serves many purposes and does it pretty well. I also have set up some sites of all kinds using this platform for my friends and would probably choose this it if asked again.

The thing is I know absolutely nothing about PHP, so I have to rely 100% on plugins to survive. So with time it becomes more and more bloated and sometimes they don't seem to play nice with each others. After a while I just grew too tired and throw my tower because I spent more time dealing with these issues I don't understand instead of writing. Last but not least I've often had trouble with their WISIWIG editor while online, especially when it comes to writing code/maths.

#Comes Pelican
I first encountered the world of blog powered by static site generation several years ago when I wrote code an app in Python and learned to use Sphinx for documentation (docutils. I really like the idea of static site generator and I find it to be the perfect fit for writing documents like blog. The only problem I had with Sphinx is its RST (reStructuredText) syntax.

Recently, I rediscover Pelican - the Python generator which allows you to write in either RST or Markdown( similar to the one used by Github for documentation - actually they are powered by Jenkyll the Ruby counterpart of Pelican).


#Advantages of Pelican
There are plenty, you can google it to see all the praises for yourself. Personally, as I've already had django/jinja knowledge and python experience, I could do pretty much everything I want (but you have to note that I don't need that much! a theme, commenting system provided by Disqus and it's good to go)

It takes me about an hour or two for setting up the whole thing (not including DNS propagation) for the site to go up. It is hosted freely by Github pages and published automatically every time I push to the master branch ( so pushes to other branches are considered as drafts). 

Later I may talk in details about how I setup my workflow ( I use the same for pretty much every web project) which may come in handy for some.
