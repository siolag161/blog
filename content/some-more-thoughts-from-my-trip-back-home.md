Summary: Something to write about

As I mentioned before, I was avoiding work during my visit back home.
I called it "e-detox". However, I did try to make some observations on
how people use tech in their daily life. One thing to note is that
I wasn't able to travel a lot, my I did spend time in multiple cities,
all of which are big and more developed however (like Sai Gon and Da Nang).

# People use smartphones everwhere
I usually start my first day in VN by fixing all the mobile devices in my home for
my family. I counted a grand number of 6. Take my mom for example, before I left
for college, she was technically useless. Now she was asking me how to integrate
her credit card to use Uber on her phone (more on this later). My gf, my father,
my sister and my brother in law all have one or more phones, all but one are smartphones.

From those who I interact with, all use smartphone everytime everywhere. Either for
calling me here in France via skype/viber or send texts to their relatives on FB.
Most of the devices are Android, with Window Phones behind but you can spot
quite a lot of iPhones too. People still have some hope in the Nokia brand,
thus explaining the success of Microsoft/WP here.

# Mobile plans are cheap
I find call/data plans rather cheap. You can buy, say 3GB of data very easily from
billions of kiots from the streets. Otherwise you can go to any cafe and enjoy their
high-speed connection. This is expected, I never saw any cafe without a proper internet
connection. This is where people to go hangout with their friend next to a cup of coffee,
surfing the nets and for some, getting some work done.

Getting a SIM card is equally easy. I think I paid 10e for my SIM card, with some
data credit and yet I still had some left. With that price, I could live with
the connection instability.

Most of the people I know use prepaid plan and never on contract, very different from here.

# FB is king
Everyone's on fb, despite all the efforts from the goverment.
There exist some competition from local services that are quite
decent like Yalo (that I don't use due to privacy concerns)
and Viber/Skype (for OTT calling/SMS). I don't think a lot of people use
Twitter, yet forums are still very popular.

# E-commerce / e-payment
You have to always have some cash with you. More and more merchandises accept
cards but far from ubiquitous and the fees are quite excessive. I successfully
convinced my mom to go to the bank to get a debit card with VISA so see can
use UBER instead of taxis. Yeah, she hated taxis that much since getting
an account/card is not an easy task (I'll write about my own expereine in the future).
Then right after that, probably one day or twos, UBER announced they give it up
and allowed cash for transactions. Well!

But of course, she could use the VISA for tons other things. E-commerce is still
in its very first step of development but has a very bright future. Since cash
rules, people opt for paying by cash on delivery. I find it rather uncomfortable
but many really dont trust e-payment.

# End

I also had a chance to talk to my friend who are very involved in the tech scene in VN.
They're all very optimistic about the future. Smartphones with connection easy to get,
people being high tech savvy and their very own habits, tons of things waiting
for being disrupted; all of those shouting potential.
